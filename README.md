# Recurrent-Neural-Network-Language-Translator
In this notebook, I used Keras to build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. The encoder-decoder, bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network model accepts English text as input and returns the French translation with over 97% accuracy.

NOTE: If you are prompted to select a kernel when you launch a notebook, choose the Python 3kernel.
